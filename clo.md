[Named after the letter M, the em unit has a long-standing tradition in typography where it has been used to measure horizontal widths. For example, the long dash (â€”) often found in American texts is known as an em dash because historically, it has had the same width as the letter M.](https://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos3e/em.en.html#:~:text=Named%20after%20the%20letter%20M,width%20as%20the%20letter%20M.)
